# NXT Timelapse Rotation (LeJos, NXJ)

Programm that turns Motor.A by X Degrees every Y seconds Z times. Has a UI with Settings included.

LeJos Firmware(www.lejos.org) needs to be installed on your NXT Brick for this to work. (Not tested with EV3, could work tho).

use nxjupload to get the .nxj file on your NXT Brick, then just run it.
